# Dead By Daylight CLI

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view character and perk information for all available Survivors and Killers in the game Dead By Daylight, as per the Official Dead By Daylight Wiki.

The interface will guide you through selection of a Survivor or Killer, allow you to view their biographies, show you available perks with descriptions, and allow you to create a full character loadout to review.

Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/DBD`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

  $ gem install DBD

## Usage

Type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

  $ dead-by-daylight

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
